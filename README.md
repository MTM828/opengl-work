This is the repository where I do all my OpenGL work.
I did a re-wrote everything on this repo because the code started to get messy.

Run `make` to build.
`bin/gl` to run.

Requires GLEW (OpenGL loader) and GLFW3 (context creation).
Shaders are in GLSL v3.3.

The reason I decided to share this is because I wanted to help OpenGL newcomers understand the fundamentals with me.
Most of the code is commented out, ask me if you don't understand anything.
